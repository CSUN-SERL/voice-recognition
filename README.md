# voice-recognition
Contains the node and a voce object "sub-node" with its own NodeHandle.
Voce will be able to run (and crash) without affecting the GCS runtime.
Will output to topic "voice_recognition"

Additional sub-nodes can be added as needed. Please branch and test before making a pull request.
